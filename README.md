# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-CLASSIFICATION-
HEART DISEASE PREDICTION (MACHINE LEARNING)

Technology used : Python Programming Language, Machine Learning algorithm (Classification).

Algorithm used : Logistic Regression, k-NeighborsClassifier, Support Vector Classifier, DecisionTree Classifier, Random forest Classifier, Bagging, Voting, Boosting, Numpy, Pandas.

In this project first I have performed a Exploratory Data Analysis on the data for getting what is a data is actually about. After cleaning the data and applying machine learning algorithm, and comparing them I have found best model for the data. Also I have created a function, so user can get wheather person is having a heart disease or not by providing some inputs.
